# LampShade User Guide




## Automation Plugin

The LampShade automation plugin supports many apps including Tasker, Locale, and Llama. These apps can use the plugin to play moods based on various conditions such as location, incoming notifications, and much more.

### How It Works

The plugin is accessed from within these apps, and provides a page for selecting which group + mood + brightness to play.

### Tasker Variables

Some advanced users prefer to dynamically pass commands into LampShade through Tasker Variables. The following are currently supported:

    %percentbrightness
Accepted values: 0-100

    %moodname
Accepted values: exact text match of the mood name to be played.
