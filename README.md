<h2>Code Style</h2>
LampShade currently uses Google's Java code style formatter rules, which is arguably better than the Android style used by default in Android Studio. intelij-java-google-style.xml contains these rules. To configure Android Studio to use these rules, see https://www.google.com/search?q=import%20code%20style%20android%20studio
